# server-side-redering-reactjs

how React applications are typically Single-Page Applications (SPAs) that can be used as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
This means the application is rendered client-side, making it load in the browser when the user visits your application.
But did you know React also supports Server-Side Rendering (SSR), as you might remember from back in the old days when code only rendered from a server?

you'll add declarative routing to a Create React App using react-router and have components dynamically loaded from the server instead of the browser.
To enable SSR, the React feature, Suspense, will be used with ReactDOMServer. If you're interested in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), this chapter will use React Helmet to add
metadata to the page so your application can be better indexed by search engines.

we will create a PWA with declarative routing using react-router that supports SSR and therefore is loaded from the server rather than the browser. Also, the application is optimized for search engines using React Helmet.
